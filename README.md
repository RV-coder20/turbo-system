# 🌌 Solar System Simulation (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)

This project is a **visual and interactive demo of the Solar System** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It represents the Sun and planets with smooth animations to demonstrate their relative motion and structure in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

The project is designed mainly for **learning and demonstration purposes**, helping beginners understand how web technologies can be used to create interactive visual simulations.

## 📖 Introduction

The Solar System Simulation is a front-end web project that visually demonstrates the planetary system orbiting around the Sun.  
Using pure **HTML for structure**, **CSS for styling and animations**, and **JavaScript for interaction and logic**, this project shows how basic web technologies can work together to create dynamic and engaging experiences.

This demo focuses on:
- Visual representation rather than scientific accuracy
- Smooth animations and clean layout
- Beginner-friendly code structure
