## 📖 Introduction

The Solar System Simulation is a front-end web project that visually demonstrates the planetary system orbiting around the Sun.  
Using pure **HTML for structure**, **CSS for styling and animations**, and **JavaScript for interaction and logic**, this project shows how basic web technologies can work together to create dynamic and engaging experiences.

This demo focuses on:
- Visual representation rather than scientific accuracy
- Smooth animations and clean layout
- Beginner-friendly code structure
